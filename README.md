# React Native: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...property...')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error and how to effectively prevent it.
The error, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...property...')`, typically arises when a component attempts to access a property of an object that's currently `null` or `undefined`.  This often occurs when working with asynchronous data or when props aren't properly handled.

This repo provides two files:

* `BuggyComponent.js`: Shows the problematic code that causes the error.
* `FixedComponent.js`: Demonstrates the corrected version with effective error handling.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
3. Run the project on your React Native environment.
4. Observe the error in the console (in `BuggyComponent.js`) and the correct behavior in `FixedComponent.js`.

## Solution

The solution primarily involves using optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators.  Optional chaining safely accesses nested properties; if any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`, it short-circuits without throwing an error. The nullish coalescing operator provides a default value if the expression is `null` or `undefined`.

## Additional considerations

* Always handle asynchronous data appropriately using loading states and error handling.
* Validate your props to ensure they exist before accessing their properties.
* Employ robust error handling throughout your application to prevent unexpected crashes.
